<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>“Freestyle Makerr” (the <em>“App”</em>) lets music lovers record freestyle vocals, play drum-pads and capture their performance. We respect your privacy and collect no personal data.</p>

<h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>No personal or analytical data is collected, stored or shared.</li>
  <li>During recording, a temporary audio file is created in the App’s sandbox and deleted when the user leaves the Playback/Export screen unless shared immediately (e.g. via WhatsApp).</li>
  <li>No backend server, no advertising SDKs, no analytics SDKs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Device Permissions</h2>
<table>
  <tr><th>Permission</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Prompt timing</th></tr>
  <tr><td>RECORD_AUDIO / Microphone</td><td>Capture freestyle vocals &amp; drum pads</td><td>First tap on “Record”</td></tr>
</table>
<p>No other permissions are requested (storage, location, camera, etc.).</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Sharing</h2>
<p>The App does not sell, rent or share any user data. No external SDKs are integrated.</p>

<h2>5. Security</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Audio files remain in the App’s private sandbox; no extra encryption is applied.</li>
  <li>With no network traffic, interception risk is minimal.</li>
  <li>The App is code-signed via Google Play App Signing and Apple App Store.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Children</h2>
<p>The App targets a general audience and is not directed to children under 13. Should we learn that information was provided by a child, it will be deleted immediately.</p>

<h2>7. Copyright</h2>
<p>All audio, graphics and text in the App are copyright-protected. Commercial use is prohibited without prior written consent from Gaon_ai.</p>

<h2>8. User Rights</h2>
<p>Because we collect no personal data, there is nothing to access, correct or delete. Feel free to contact us via e-mail.</p>

<h2>9. Changes</h2>
<p>We may update this Policy from time to time; the new date will appear at the top. Material changes will be highlighted in-App.</p>

<h2>10. GDPR &amp; CCPA Compliance</h2>
<p>The App is available worldwide. As of today no personal data is processed; should that change we will request explicit consent and update this Policy accordingly.</p>
